Second, I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital. That said, the world obviously went crazy with excess vaccination against ‘Covid-19.’ I have that in quotes, because the RNA sequences changed so much that I called it the virus of Theseus. So many people I know had serious side effects from the vaccines, including myself. Failure to acknowledge that is a lie. As for the deaths you claim are due to Covid-19, why is the nation of Sweden still alive!? Just go on Rogan and do the debate.\"Kennedy himself tweeted he wanted to have the debate as well. Eventually Mark Cuban got into the mix, slamming Rogan\\'s challenge as \"bulls--t\" and willfully ignoring the lives saved by the pharmaceutical industry in spite of its issues.As the story drew more attention over the weekend, Hotez eventually found himself face-to-face with people telling him to debate Kennedy.On Sunday, independent journalist Alex Rosen filmed himself greeting Hotez outside his home and asking why he wouldn\\'t debate. Hotez smiled but said Rosen was harassing him, and he said he would give the matter some thought.\"He just invited me, so we\\'ll see,\" Hotez told him, adding, \"Don\\'t come to my house.\"MUSK SUGGESTS TRUMP IS BEING TARGETED AFTER INDICTMENT: ‘FAR HIGHER INTEREST IN PURSING TRUMP’ THAN OTHERSHotez appeared on MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan\\'s program Sunday to explain, however, why he wouldn\\'t \"debate\" vaccines with Kennedy, saying in science it was more typical to write papers instead.\"I have a new book coming out that basically says 200,000 Americans needlessly perished, because they believed the anti-vaccine disinformation and refused to take a COVID vaccine during our Delta wave and BA.1 Omicron wave in 2021-22 after vaccines were widely available,\" he said. \"So the point is anti-vaccine disinformation, it’s always done a lot of damage and harm, but now it’s a lethal force in the United States, and that’s why we have to have that discussion. And I offered to come and go on Joe Rogan again… I’ve been on a couple of times and have that discussion with it, but not to turn it into the Jerry Springer Show with having RFK Jr on.\"Hotez added it was wrong of Kennedy, who is polling at 20 percent in some Democratic surveys, to call him a shill for the pharmaceutical industry.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHotez has been heavily cited in the media over the course of the pandemic but has taken criticism for his aggressive posture toward COVID vaccines and masks for children, in spite of the extremely low rate of coronavirus mortality for those aged 0-17.
