In early July 2008, Samuel Alito stood on a riverbank in a remote corner of Alaska. The Supreme Court justice was on vacation at a luxury fishing lodge that charged more than $1,000 a day, and after catching a king salmon nearly the size of his leg, Alito posed for a picture. To his left, a man stood beaming: Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire who has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to rule in his favor in high-stakes business disputes.

Singer was more than a fellow angler. He flew Alito to Alaska on a private jet. If the justice chartered the plane himself, the cost could have exceeded $100,000 one way.

In the years that followed, Singer’s hedge fund came before the court at least 10 times in cases where his role was often covered by the legal press and mainstream media. In 2014, the court agreed to resolve a key issue in a decade-long battle between Singer’s hedge fund and the nation of Argentina. Alito did not recuse himself from the case and voted with the 7-1 majority in Singer’s favor. The hedge fund was ultimately paid $2.4 billion.

Alito did not report the 2008 fishing trip on his annual financial disclosures. By failing to disclose the private jet flight Singer provided, Alito appears to have violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts, according to ethics law experts.

Experts said they could not identify an instance of a justice ruling on a case after receiving an expensive gift paid for by one of the parties.

“If you were good friends, what were you doing ruling on his case?” said Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor and leading expert on recusals. “And if you weren’t good friends, what were you doing accepting this?” referring to the flight on the private jet.

Justices are almost entirely left to police themselves on ethical issues, with few restrictions on what gifts they can accept. When a potential conflict arises, the sole arbiter of whether a justice should step away from a case is the justice him or herself.

ProPublica’s investigation sheds new light on how luxury travel has given prominent political donors — including one who has had cases before the Supreme Court — intimate access to the most powerful judges in the country. Another wealthy businessman provided expensive vacations to two members of the high court, ProPublica found. On his Alaska trip, Alito stayed at a commercial fishing lodge owned by this businessman, who was also a major conservative donor. Three years before, that same businessman flew Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, on a private jet to Alaska and paid the bill for his stay.

Such trips would be unheard of for the vast majority of federal workers, who are generally barred from taking even modest gifts.

Leonard Leo, the longtime leader of the conservative Federalist Society, attended and helped organize the Alaska fishing vacation. Leo invited Singer to join, according to a person familiar with the trip, and asked Singer if he and Alito could fly on the billionaire’s jet. Leo had recently played an important role in the justice’s confirmation to the court. Singer and the lodge owner were both major donors to Leo’s political groups.

ProPublica’s examination of Alito’s and Scalia’s travel drew on trip planning emails, Alaska fishing licenses, and interviews with dozens of people including private jet pilots, fishing guides, former high-level employees of both Singer and the lodge owner, and other guests on the trips.

ProPublica sent Alito a list of detailed questions last week, and on Tuesday, the Supreme Court’s head spokeswoman told ProPublica that Alito would not be commenting. Several hours later, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by Alito responding to ProPublica’s questions about the trip.

Alito said that when Singer’s companies came before the court, the justice was unaware of the billionaire’s connection to the cases. He said he recalled speaking to Singer on “no more than a handful of occasions,” and they never discussed Singer’s business or issues before the court.

Alito said that he was invited to fly on Singer’s plane shortly before the trip and that the seat “​​would have otherwise been vacant.” He defended his failure to report the trip to the public, writing that justices “commonly interpreted” the disclosure requirements to not include “accommodations and transportation for social events.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for Singer told ProPublica that Singer didn’t organize the trip and that he wasn’t aware Alito would be attending when he accepted the invitation. Singer “never discussed his business interests” with the justice, the spokesperson said, adding that at the time of trip, neither Singer nor his companies had “any pending matters before the Supreme Court, nor could Mr. Singer have anticipated in 2008 that a subsequent matter would arise that would merit Supreme Court review.”

Leo did not respond to questions about his organizing the trip but said in a statement that he “would never presume to tell” Alito and Scalia “what to do.”

This spring, ProPublica reported that Justice Clarence Thomas received decades of luxury travel from another Republican megadonor, Dallas real estate magnate Harlan Crow. In a statement, Thomas defended the undisclosed trips, saying unnamed colleagues advised him that he didn’t need to report such gifts to the public. Crow also gave Thomas money in an undisclosed real estate deal and paid private school tuition for his grandnephew, who Thomas was raising as a son. Thomas reported neither transaction on his disclosure forms.

The undisclosed gifts have prompted lawmakers to launch investigations and call for ethics reform. Recent bills would impose tighter rules for justices’ recusals, require the Supreme Court to adopt a binding code of conduct and create an ethics body, which would investigate complaints. Neither a code nor an ethics office currently exists.

“We wouldn’t tolerate this from a city council member or an alderman,” Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said of Thomas in a recent hearing. “And yet the Supreme Court won’t even acknowledge it’s a problem.”

So far, the court has chafed at the prospect of such reforms. Though the court recently laid out its ethics practices in a statement signed by all nine justices, Chief Justice John Roberts has not directly addressed the recent revelations. In fact, he has repeatedly suggested Congress might not have the power to regulate the court at all.

“We Take Good Care of Him Because He Makes All the Rules”

In the 1960s in his first year at Harvard Law School, Singer was listening to a lecture by a famed liberal professor when, he later recalled, he had an epiphany: “My goodness. They’re making it up as they go along.”

It was a common sentiment among conservative lawyers, who often accuse liberal judges of activist overreach. While Singer’s career as an attorney was short-lived, his convictions about the law stayed with him for decades. After starting a hedge fund that eventually made him one of the richest people in the country, he began directing huge sums to causes on the right. That included groups, like the Federalist Society, dedicated to fostering the conservative legal movement and putting its followers on the bench.

In the last decade, Singer has contributed over $80 million to Republican political groups. He has also given millions to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank where he has served as chairman since 2008. The institute regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs with the Supreme Court — at least 15 this term, including one asking the court to block student loan relief.

Singer’s interest in the courts is more than ideological. His hedge fund, Elliott Management, is best known for making investments that promise handsome returns but could require bruising legal battles. Singer has said he’s drawn to positions where you “control your own destiny, not just riding up and down with the waves of financial markets.” That can mean pressuring corporate boards to fire a CEO, brawling with creditors over the remains of a bankrupt company and suing opponents.

The fund now manages more than $50 billion in assets. “The investments are extremely shrewdly litigation-driven,” a person familiar with Singer’s fund told ProPublica. “That’s why he’s a billionaire.”

Singer’s most famous gamble eventually made its way to the Supreme Court.

In 2001, Argentina was in a devastating economic depression. Unemployment skyrocketed and deadly riots broke out in the street. The day after Christmas, the government finally went into default. For Singer, the crisis was an opportunity. As other investors fled, his fund purchased Argentine government debt at a steep discount.

Within several years, as the Argentine economy recovered, most creditors settled with the government and accepted a fraction of what the debt was originally worth. But Singer’s fund, an arm of Elliott called NML Capital, held out. Soon, they were at war: a midtown Manhattan-based hedge fund trying to impose its will on a sovereign nation thousands of miles away.

The fight played out on familiar turf for Singer: the U.S. courts. He launched an aggressive legal campaign to force Argentina to pay in full, and his personal involvement in the case attracted widespread media attention. Over 13 years of litigation, the arguments spanned what rights foreign governments have in the U.S. and whether Argentina could pay off debts to others before Singer settled his claim.

If Singer succeeded, he stood to make a fortune.

In 2007, for the first but not the last time, Singer’s fund asked the Supreme Court to intervene. A lower court had stopped Singer and another fund from seizing Argentine central bank funds held in the U.S. The investors appealed, but that October, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.

On July 8 of the following year, Singer took Alito to Alaska on the private jet, according to emails, flight data from the Federal Aviation Administration and people familiar with the trip.

The group flew across the country to the town of King Salmon on the Alaska peninsula. They returned to the East Coast three days later.

In Alaska, they stayed at the King Salmon Lodge, a luxury fishing resort that drew celebrities, wealthy businessmen and sports stars. On July 9, one of the lodge’s pilots flew Alito and other guests around 70 miles to the west to fish the Nushagak River, known for one of the best salmon runs in the world. Snapshots from the trip show Alito in waders and an Indianapolis Grand Prix hat, smiling broadly as he holds his catch.

“Sam Alito is in the red jacket there,” one lodge worker said, as he narrated an amateur video of the justice on the water. “We take good care of him because he makes all the rules.”

Other guests on the trip included Leo, the Federalist Society leader, and Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a prominent conservative appellate judge for whom Leo had clerked, according to fishing licenses and interviews with lodge staff.

On another day, the group flew on one of the lodge’s bush planes to a waterfall in Katmai National Park, where bears snatch salmon from the water with their teeth. At night, the lodge’s chefs served multicourse meals of Alaskan king crab legs or Kobe filet. On the last evening, a member of Alito’s group bragged that the wine they were drinking cost $1,000 a bottle, one of the lodge’s fishing guides told ProPublica.

In his op-ed, Alito described the lodge as a “comfortable but rustic facility.” The justice said he does not remember if he was served wine, but if he was, it didn’t cost $1,000 a bottle. (Alito also pointed readers to the lodge’s website. The lodge has been sold since 2008 and is now a more downscale accommodation.)

The justice’s stay was provided free of charge by another major donor to the conservative legal movement: Robin Arkley II, the owner of a mortgage company then based in California. Arkley had recently acquired the fishing lodge, which catered to affluent tourists seeking a luxury experience in the Alaskan wilderness. A planning document prepared by lodge staff describes Alito as a guest of Arkley. Another guest on the trip told ProPublica the trip was a gift from Arkley, and two lodge employees said they were told that Alito wasn’t paying.

Arkley, who does not appear to have been involved in any cases before the court, did not respond to detailed questions for this story.

Alito did not disclose the flight or the stay at the fishing lodge in his annual financial disclosures. A federal law passed after Watergate requires federal officials including Supreme Court justices to publicly report most gifts. (The year before, Alito reported getting $500 of Italian food and wine from a friend, noting that his friend was unlikely to “appear before this Court.”)

The law has a “personal hospitality” exemption: If someone hosts a justice on their own property, free “food, lodging, or entertainment” don’t always have to be disclosed. But the law clearly requires disclosure for gifts of private jet flights, according to seven ethics law experts, and Alito appears to have violated it. The typical interpretation of the law required disclosure for his stay at the lodge too, experts said, since it was a commercial property rather than a vacation home. The judiciary’s regulations did not make that explicit until they were updated earlier this year.

In his op-ed, Alito said that justices “commonly interpreted” the law’s exception for hospitality “to mean that accommodations and transportation for social events were not reportable gifts.”

His op-ed pointed to language in the judiciary’s filing instructions and cited definitions from Black’s Law Dictionary and Webster’s. But he did not make reference to the judiciary’s regulations or the law itself, which experts said both clearly required disclosure for gifts of travel. ProPublica found at least six examples of other federal judges disclosing gifts of private jet travel in recent years.

“The exception only covers food, lodging and entertainment,” said Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer now at the watchdog group CREW. “He’s trying to move away from the plain language of the statute and the regulation.”

The Alaska vacation was the first time Singer and Alito met, according to a person familiar with the trip. After the trip, the two appeared together at public events. When Alito spoke at the annual dinner of the Federalist Society lawyers convention the following year, the billionaire introduced him. The justice told a story about having an encounter with bears during a fishing trip with Singer, according to the legal blog Above the Law. He recalled asking himself: “Do you really want to go down in history as the first Supreme Court justice to be devoured by a bear?”

The year after that, in 2010, Alito delivered the keynote speech at a dinner for donors to the Manhattan Institute. Once again, Singer delivered a flattering introduction. “He and his small band of like-minded justices are a critical and much-appreciated bulwark of our freedom,” Singer told the crowd. “Samuel Alito is a model Supreme Court justice.”

The court cases and known interactions between Alito and Singer July 2008 Singer flies Alito on a private jet to Alaska, where they spend days vacationing at a luxury lodge. May 2007 Singer's fund asks the court to intervene in the Argentina litigation. It declined later that year. 2008 November 2009 Singer introduces Alito at a Federalist Society dinner. December 2009 Singer's Argentina dispute spurs eight more Supreme Court appeals – seven of which are turned down. 2010 October 2010 Singer introduces Alito at a Manhattan Institute dinner. 2012 2014 June 2014 The court agrees to take one Argentina case in 2014. In June of that year, it rules 7:1 in Singer's favor, with Alito in the majority. 2016 2018 January 2019 A utility company asks the court to intervene in a dispute with Singer's fund. The court ultimately declined. 2020 2022 March 2023 A bank asks the court to intervene in a dispute with Singer's fund. The request is still pending.

Meanwhile, Singer and Argentina kept asking the Supreme Court to intervene in their legal fight. His fund enlisted Ted Olson, the famed appellate lawyer who represented George W. Bush in the Bush v. Gore case during the 2000 presidential election.

In January 2010, a year and a half after the Alaska vacation, the fund once again asked the high court to take up an aspect of the dispute. The court declined. In total, parties asked the court to hear appeals in the litigation eight times in the six years after the trip. In most instances, it was Singer’s adversaries filing an appeal, with Singer’s fund successfully arguing for the justices to decline the case and let stand a lower court ruling.

The Supreme Court hears a tiny portion of the many cases it’s asked to rule on each year. Under the court’s rules, cases are only accepted when at least four of the nine justices vote to take it up. The deliberations on whether to take a case are shrouded in secrecy and happen at meetings attended only by the justices. These decisions are a fundamental way the court wields power. The justices’ votes are not typically made public, so it is unclear how Alito voted on the petitions involving Singer.

As Singer’s battle with Argentina intensified, his hedge fund launched an expansive public relations and lobbying campaign. In 2012, the hedge fund even attempted to seize an Argentine navy ship docked in Ghana to secure payment from the country. (The effort was thwarted by a ruling from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.) Argentina’s president labeled Singer and his fellow investors “vultures” attempting extortion; Singer complained the country was scapegoating him.

In 2014, the Supreme Court finally agreed to hear a case on the matter. It centered on an important issue: how much protection Argentina could claim as a sovereign nation against the hedge fund’s legal maneuvers in U.S. courts. The U.S. government filed a brief on Argentina’s side, warning that the case raised “extraordinarily sensitive foreign policy concerns.”

The case featured an unusual intervention by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group affiliated with Leo known for spending millions on judicial confirmation fights. The group filed a brief supporting Singer, which appears to be the only Supreme Court friend-of-the-court brief in the organization’s history.

The court ruled in Singer’s favor 7-1 with Alito joining the majority. The justice did not recuse himself from the case or from any of the other petitions involving Singer.

“The tide turned” thanks to that “decisive” ruling and another from the court, as Singer’s law firm described it. After the legal setbacks and the election of a new president in Argentina, the country finally capitulated in 2016. Singer’s fund walked away with a $2.4 billion payout, a spectacular return.

Abbe Smith, a law professor at Georgetown who co-wrote a textbook on legal and judicial ethics, said that Alito should have recused himself. If she were representing a client and learned the judge had taken a gift from the party on the other side, Smith said, she would immediately move for recusal. “If I found out after the fact, I’d be outraged on behalf of my client,” she said. “And, frankly, I’d be outraged on behalf of the legal system.”

The law that governs when justices must recuse themselves from a case sets a high but subjective standard. It requires justices to withdraw from any case when their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” But the court allows individual justices to interpret that requirement for themselves. Historically, they’ve almost never explained why they are or are not recusing themselves, and unlike lower court judges, their decisions cannot be appealed.

Alito articulated his own standard during his Senate confirmation process, writing that he believed in stepping away from cases when “any possible question might arise.”

In his Wall Street Journal op-ed, Alito wrote of his failure to recuse himself from Singer’s cases at the court: “It was and is my judgment that these facts would not cause a reasonable and unbiased person to doubt my ability to decide the matters in question impartially.”

Critics have long assailed the Supreme Court’s practices on this issue as both opaque and inconsistent. “The idea ‘just trust us to do the right thing’ while remaining in total secrecy is unworkable,” said Amanda Frost, a judicial ethics expert at the University of Virginia School of Law.

For Singer, appeals to the Supreme Court are an almost unavoidable result of his business model. Since the Argentina case, Singer’s funds were named parties in at least two other cases that were appealed to the court, both stemming from battles with Fortune 500 companies. One of the petitions is currently pending.

Grey Goose and Glacier Ice

The month after Singer got home from the 2008 fishing trip, he realized he had a problem. He was supposed to receive a shipment of frozen salmon from the Alaska lodge. But the fish hadn’t arrived. So the billionaire emailed an unlikely person to get to the bottom of it: Leo, the powerful Federalist Society executive.

“They've escaped!!” Singer wrote. Leo then sent an email to Arkley, the lodge owner, to track down the missing seafood.

The only clear thread connecting the prominent guests on the trip is that they all had a relationship with Leo. Leo is now a giant in judicial politics who helped handpick Donald Trump’s list of potential Supreme Court nominees and recently received a $1.6 billion donation to further his political interests. Leo’s network of political groups was in its early days, however, when he traveled with Alito to Alaska. It had run an advertising campaign supporting Alito in his confirmation fight, and Leo was reportedly part of the team that prepared Alito for his Senate hearings.

Singer and Arkley, the businessmen who provided the trip to the justice, were both significant donors to Leo’s groups at the time, according to public records and reporting by The Daily Beast. Arkley also sometimes provided Leo with one of his private planes to travel to business meetings, according to a former pilot of Arkley’s.

In his statement, Leo did not address detailed questions about the trip, but he said “no objective and well-informed observer of the judiciary honestly could believe that they decide cases in order to cull favor with friends, or in return for a free plane seat or fishing trip.”

He added that the public should wonder whether ProPublica’s coverage is “bait for reeling in more dark money from woke billionaires who want to damage this Supreme Court and remake it into one that will disregard the law by rubber stamping their disordered and highly unpopular cultural preferences.”

Arkley is a fixture in local politics in his hometown of Eureka, California, known for lashing out at city officials and for once starting his own newspaper reportedly out of disdain for the local press. By the early 2000s, he’d made a fortune buying and servicing distressed mortgages and also become a significant donor in national GOP politics.

As his political profile rose, Arkley bragged to friends that he’d gotten to know one-third of the sitting Supreme Court justices. He told friends he had a relationship with Clarence Thomas, according to two people who were close with Arkley. And the Alito trip was not Arkley’s first time covering a Supreme Court justice’s travel to Alaska.

In June 2005, Arkley flew Scalia on his private jet to Kodiak Island, Alaska, two of Arkley’s former pilots told ProPublica. Arkley had paid to rent out a remote fishing lodge that cost $3,200 a week per person, according to the lodge’s owner, Martha Sikes.

Snapshots from the trip, found in the justice’s papers at Harvard Law School, capture Scalia knee-deep in a river as he fights to reel in a fish. Randolph, the appellate judge who was also on the later trip, joined Scalia and Arkley on the vacation, flying on the businessman’s jet.

Scalia did not report the trip on his annual filing, another apparent violation of the law, according to ethics law experts. Scalia’s travels briefly drew scrutiny in 2016 after he died while staying at the hunting ranch of a Texas businessman. Scalia had a pattern of disclosing trips to deliver lectures while not mentioning hunting excursions he took to nearby locales hosted by local attorneys and businessmen, according to a research paper published after his death.

Randolph, now a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, did not disclose the trip. (Nor did he disclose the later trip with Alito.) Randolph told ProPublica that when he was preparing his form for 2005, he called the judiciary’s financial disclosure office to ask about disclosing the trip. He shared his notes from the call with a staffer, which say “don’t have to report trip to Alaska with Rob Arkley & others / private jet / lodge.” Kathleen Clark, an ethics law expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said, “I don’t understand how the staff member came to that conclusion based on the language in the statute.”

On June 9, Arkley’s group chartered a boat, the Happy Hooker IV, to tour Yakutat Bay. On the way over, Scalia and Arkley discussed whether Senate Republicans, then in a contentious fight over judicial confirmations, should abolish the filibuster to move forward, according to a person traveling with them.

A photo captures Arkley and Scalia later that day gazing off the side of the boat at the famed Hubbard Glacier. At one point, a guide chiseled chunks off an iceberg and passed them to Scalia. The justice then mixed martinis from Grey Goose vodka and glacier ice.

ProPublica Read More Behind the Scenes of Justice Alito’s Unprecedented Wall Street Journal Pre-buttal

It remains unclear how Scalia ended up in Alaska with Arkley. But the justice’s archives at Harvard Law School offer a tantalizing clue. Immediately before the fishing trip, Scalia gave a speech for the Federalist Society in Napa, California. The next day, Arkley’s plane flew from Napa to Alaska. Scalia’s papers contain a folder labeled “Federalist Society, Napa and Alaska, 2005 June 3-10,” suggesting a possible connection between the conservative organization and the fishing trip.

The contents of that folder are currently sealed, however. They will be opened to the public in 2036.

CNN —

The legal cloud hanging over Hunter Biden, the president’s son, may be lifting, but the political cloud resulting from his awkward business arrangements and frequently troubled life are not going anywhere.

Biden has agreed to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors after years of “willful failure” to pay federal income tax. He is also working with prosecutors to avoid trial for violation of federal law after his purchase of a handgun at a time when he was addicted to drugs. The firearm was later thrown into a dumpster by his then-girlfriend, who is also his brother’s widow.

“It is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter is resolved,” his lawyer Christopher Clark said in a statement after the filing of court documents related to the agreements.

He argued the president’s son has turned a page in his life.

“I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward,” Clark said.

But it’s not entirely clear that the US attorney’s office sees things with the same level of closure; its statement refers to the case as “ongoing,” perhaps in part because a judge has not signed off and perhaps because there are other matters we don’t know about.

Who is the US attorney overseeing this deal?

Importantly, the attorney who has led the Hunter Biden probe is a Republican and a Donald Trump appointee.

In 2018, when he was confirmed by the Senate to be US attorney for the District of Delaware, David Weiss was listed by Trump as a lawyer who shared his vision for “Making America Safe Again,” CNN’s profile notes.

About the gun charge. What is a pretrial diversion program?

Clark said the firearm charge “will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement.”

According to the Department of Justice website, this is a discretionary option available to US attorneys to “divert certain offenders from traditional criminal justice processing into alternative systems of supervision and services.”

What are the max penalties for these crimes?

Gun charges for someone addicted to drugs can carry up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to the court documents. Each of the tax charges could be punished by up to a year in prison and either a $100,000 fine or twice the gain or loss from the offense.

Details of the exact plea agreement will be forthcoming. But the government will recommend probation for Biden, meaning no jail time. A judge has to sign off on the agreement.

How much did Hunter Biden owe in taxes?

The exact figure is not clear from the agreement, but it sounds like a lot of money.

He made more than $1.5 million in taxable income in both 2017 and 2018 and owed more than $100,000 in each of those years, according to the court documents.

His attorneys said last July that he had already paid all of his back taxes. CNN has reported that emails between Hunter Biden and his accountant in October 2018 suggested he had not filed his 2017 taxes – six months after the deadline.

There is nothing in the agreement about earlier tax years, but that July 2022 CNN report also included an email from his accountant in 2018 that said he still owed $158,000 for the 2015 tax year.

Hunter Biden’s finances have clearly been an ongoing problem.

How much exactly was Hunter Biden making during those years and from whom?

Again, it’s not entirely clear.

We do know that during those years he was making as much as $50,000 per month sitting on one board, for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. This agreement does not disclose his total income or his entire tax bill.

Will this end public or Republican interest in Hunter Biden and his finances?

No. Far from it.

Republicans have pointed to financial records that show Hunter and other Biden family members were paid more than $10 million from foreign sources alone between 2015 and 2017.

Republican investigators in the House have pledged to subpoena bank records to learn more. They have tried to imply that President Joe Biden was involved in some of these financial arrangements, but there is so far no evidence to support the claim.

Republicans have also complained that an informant’s tip suggesting some Joe Biden involvement while he was vice president was not more thoroughly investigated by the FBI. But it’s notable that the investigation in question – we’re not sure who it was with – was conducted during the Trump administration.

Why does everyone know so much about Hunter Biden’s finances?

The infamous laptop that turned up at a Delaware repair shop before the 2020 election had a lot of information. CNN’s investigative team hired a cyber forensics expert to help authenticate a cache of emails related to Hunter Biden’s finances that were allegedly traced back to the laptop and posted on the internet by a former Trump White House aide.

As the investigative team noted last July: Information from the laptop has fueled countless stories about Biden’s drug abuse, alleged sexual indiscretions and money trouble, many of which CNN – and other media outlets – have not been able to verify.

Hunter Biden’s current income is also a line of inquiry for Republicans

He is an artist who gets top dollar for works displayed at shows. He and the White House have pledged not to learn the identities of people who buy his work.

Plus, he is involved in a child support disagreement in Arkansas. His attorneys have said he can no longer afford to pay $20,000 in child support. He could be forced to turn over more detailed financial data as part of those proceedings.

‘Slap on the wrist’

Republican lawmakers who have focused on Hunter Biden are not waiting for this plea agreement to be finalized to criticize it.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said it was a “sweetheart” plea deal and a “slap on the wrist.”

Trump compared the plea deal with the DOJ essentially giving Biden a traffic ticket.

Add to that criticism the IRS whistleblower who has told Republicans on Capitol Hill there is political influence in the Hunter Biden investigation at the DOJ.

That means that while Hunter Biden is likely to avoid jail, he’s far from done being the target of investigations now that Republicans control the House.",left

The vaccine scientist Peter Hotez says it's been ""overwhelming"" getting tag-teamed on Twitter by some of the platform's most influential voices.

""You know, the attacks from the anti-vaccine lobby do come in waves. And this time, though, it's been one of the tougher ones. Because, as you pointed out, the physical stalking and the incessant threatening emails,"" Hotez told MSNBC's Mehdi Hasan on Sunday night.

""And the stuff online is just total whack-a-doodle. And let's face it, when you have RFK Jr. and Joe Rogan, and Elon Musk, all tag-teaming, those tres hombres at the same time,"" Hotez added. ""That probably includes just about every follower on Twitter. So, it's pretty overwhelming.""

Hotez tweeted on Sunday that some anti-vaxxers had harassed him at home.

""Ugh I just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of antivaxers taunting me to debate RFKJr,"" Hotez wrote. ""Of course I was looking my Sunday best in our brutal heat wave. What is it with people?""

Hotez became the target of widespread ire after he tweeted in support of a Vice article published on Friday titled: ""Spotify Has Stopped Even Sort of Trying to Stem Joe Rogan's Vaccine Misinformation."" The episode featured the presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who discussed his conspiracy theory-fueled stance on vaccines during a three-hour episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

After Hotez's supportive tweet, Rogan responded on Saturday, writing: ""Peter, if you claim what RFKjr is saying is 'misinformation' I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.""

The billionaire investor Bill Ackman also waded into the fray and added $150,000 to the debate wager. Ackman said he was upping the amount in the pot so the ""public can hear an open debate on an important topic.""

Hotez's subsequent reluctance to debate Kennedy, however, added to the firestorm of criticism he received. Hotez was accused by Twitter users — including Musk — of being afraid of debating RFK Jr. publicly.

Hotez told MSNBC's Hasan that he drew the line at duking it out with Kennedy debate-style.

""I offered to go on Joe Rogan but not to turn it into the Jerry Springer show with having RFK Jr. on,"" Hotez said.

Hotez tweeted on Sunday night about why he didn't intend to wade into a debate with Kennedy.

""First, science is not something that is typically debated like say 18th enlightenment philosophy or political issues,"" Hotez added.

""I'm not even certain I know how to 'debate' in this case. And then there is the particular problem of debating RFK Jr on this. I have spoken to him over the years and I'm willing to speak to him again, but it's not easy, he tends to move the goalposts on his specific concerns about vaccines,"" Hotez wrote.

Hotez added that he would still be willing to speak to Rogan about vaccines and was open to doing ""something with Elon on Twitter.""

Kennedy, who is making a bid for the 2024 Democratic nomination, repeated unfounded claims he has long made like vaccines cause autism, and he and Rogan also discussed what they viewed as the dangers of 5G technology and the power of the pharmaceutical industry.

Several other figures also offered large sums to encourage Hotez – a frequent guest on CNN and MSNBC during the pandemic who pushed controversial mask and vaccine mandates – to debate with Kennedy, the Democratic scion who has been praised by some corners of the right for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines.

BIDEN'S WHITE HOUSE AIDES ADMIT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS ODD SAYINGS MEAN: REPORT

After Hotez said he would be happy to talk to Rogan, Rogan shot back it was a ""non-answer"" and that Hotez had agreed with a ""dogs--t"" Vice article that attacked his interview with Kennedy. Several other outlets along with Vice also attacked Spotify, the streaming giant that airs Rogan's show, for not labeling the interview misinformation.

Musk, the billionaire Twitter owner who often ventures into debates and discussions on the platform, chimed in that Hotez was ""afraid of a public debate."" Hotez called Musk's posture ""monstrous,"" to which Musk responded that he was generally pro-vaccine but had concerns about the COVID shots.

""I am generally pro vaccine,"" he wrote. ""I have been vaccinated against pretty much everything, as have my kids. Second, I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital. That said, the world obviously went crazy with excess vaccination against ‘Covid-19.’ I have that in quotes, because the RNA sequences changed so much that I called it the virus of Theseus. So many people I know had serious side effects from the vaccines, including myself. Failure to acknowledge that is a lie. As for the deaths you claim are due to Covid-19, why is the nation of Sweden still alive!? Just go on Rogan and do the debate.""

Kennedy himself tweeted he wanted to have the debate as well. Eventually Mark Cuban got into the mix, slamming Rogan's challenge as ""bulls--t"" and willfully ignoring the lives saved by the pharmaceutical industry in spite of its issues.

As the story drew more attention over the weekend, Hotez eventually found himself face-to-face with people telling him to debate Kennedy.

On Sunday, independent journalist Alex Rosen filmed himself greeting Hotez outside his home and asking why he wouldn't debate. Hotez smiled but said Rosen was harassing him, and he said he would give the matter some thought.

""He just invited me, so we'll see,"" Hotez told him, adding, ""Don't come to my house.""

MUSK SUGGESTS TRUMP IS BEING TARGETED AFTER INDICTMENT: ‘FAR HIGHER INTEREST IN PURSING TRUMP’ THAN OTHERS

Hotez appeared on MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan's program Sunday to explain, however, why he wouldn't ""debate"" vaccines with Kennedy, saying in science it was more typical to write papers instead.

""I have a new book coming out that basically says 200,000 Americans needlessly perished, because they believed the anti-vaccine disinformation and refused to take a COVID vaccine during our Delta wave and BA.1 Omicron wave in 2021-22 after vaccines were widely available,"" he said. ""So the point is anti-vaccine disinformation, it’s always done a lot of damage and harm, but now it’s a lethal force in the United States, and that’s why we have to have that discussion. And I offered to come and go on Joe Rogan again… I’ve been on a couple of times and have that discussion with it, but not to turn it into the Jerry Springer Show with having RFK Jr on.""

Hotez added it was wrong of Kennedy, who is polling at 20 percent in some Democratic surveys, to call him a shill for the pharmaceutical industry.

As part of the agreement, made public Tuesday, Hunter Biden will plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and is expected to reach an agreement with prosecutors on the felony charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a drug user. It is somewhat unusual to resolve a federal criminal case at the same time...","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s son Hunter will plead guilty to federal tax offenses but avoid full prosecution on a separate gun charge in a deal with the Justice Department that likely spares him time behind bars.

Hunter Biden, 53, will plead guilty to the misdemeanor tax offenses as part of an agreement made public Tuesday. The agreement will also avert prosecution on a felony charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a drug user, as long as he adheres to conditions agreed to in court.

The deal ends a long-running Justice Department investigation into the taxes and foreign business dealings of President Biden’s second son, who has acknowledged struggling with addiction following the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden. It also averts a trial that would have generated days or weeks of distracting headlines for a White House that has strenuously sought to keep its distance from the Justice Department.

The president, asked about the development at a meeting on another subject in California, said simply, “I’m very proud of my son.” The White House counsel’s office said in a statement that the president and first lady Jill Biden “love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life.”

While the agreement requires the younger Biden to admit guilt, the deal is narrowly focused on tax and weapons violations rather than anything broader or tied to the Democratic president. Nonetheless, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans continued to try to use the case to shine an unflattering spotlight on Joe Biden and to raise questions about the independence of the Biden Justice Department.

Trump, challenging President Biden in the 2024 presidential race, likened the agreement to a “mere traffic ticket,” adding, “Our system is BROKEN!”

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy compared the outcome to the Trump documents case now heading toward federal court and said, “If you are the president’s son, you get a sweetheart deal.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another presidential challenger, used the same term.

Two people familiar with the investigation said the Justice Department would recommend 24 months of probation for the tax charges, meaning Hunter Biden will not face time in prison. But the decision to go along with any deal is up to the judge. The people were not authorized to speak publicly by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

He is to plead guilty to failing to pay more than $100,000 in taxes on over $1.5 million in income in both 2017 and 2018, charges that carry a maximum possible penalty of a year in prison. The back taxes have since been paid, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

The gun charge states that Hunter Biden possessed a handgun, a Colt Cobra .38 Special, for 11 days in October 2018 despite knowing he was a drug user. The rarely filed count carries a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison, but the Justice Department said Hunter Biden had reached a pretrial agreement. This likely means as long as he adheres to the conditions, the case will be wiped from his record.

Christopher Clark, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was his understanding that the five-year investigation had now been resolved.

“I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life,” Clark said. “He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.”

The agreement comes as the Justice Department pursues perhaps the most consequential case in its history against Trump, the first former president to face federal criminal charges. The resolution of Hunter Biden’s case comes just days after a 37-count indictment against Trump in relation to accusations of mishandling classified documents on his Florida estate. It was filed by a special counsel, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the Justice Department.

That indictment has nevertheless brought an onslaught of Republican criticism of “politicization” of the Justice Department. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans continue to pursue their own investigations into nearly every facet of Hunter Biden’s business dealings, including foreign payments.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the younger Biden is “getting away with a slap on the wrist,” despite investigations in Congress that GOP lawmakers say show — but have not yet provided evidence of — a pattern of corruption involving the family’s financial ties.

Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, on the other hand, said the case was thoroughly investigated over five years by U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Delaware prosecutor appointed by Trump.

Resolution of the case, Coons said, “brings to a close a five-year investigation, despite the elaborate conspiracy theories spun by many who believed there would be much more to this.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was scheduled to campaign with the president Tuesday evening, reaffirmed his support for Biden’s reelection.

“Hunter changes nothing,” Newsom told the AP on Tuesday.

Misdemeanor tax cases aren’t common, and most that are filed end with a sentence that doesn’t include time behind bars, said Caroline Ciraolo, an attorney who served as head of the Justice Department’s tax division from 2015 to 2017. An expected federal conviction “is not a slap on the wrist,” she said.

Gun possession charges that aren’t associated with another firearm crime are also uncommon, said Keith Rosen, a past head of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware. For people without a significant criminal history, the total number of multiple types of illegal possession cases filed every year in Delaware amounts to a handful, he said.

The Justice Department investigation into the president’s son burst into public view in December 2020, one month after the 2020 election, when Hunter Biden revealed that he had received a subpoena as part of the department’s scrutiny of his taxes. The subpoena sought information on the younger Biden’s business dealings with a number of entities, including Burisma, a Ukraine gas company on whose board he sat. A federal grand jury in Delaware heard testimony related to his taxes and foreign business transactions.

In February 2021, the department sought the resignation of most Trump-era U.S. attorneys, as is customary in a new presidential administration, but made a point of noting that it was leaving Weiss in place as a way to ensure continuity in the probe. Weiss said in a June 7 letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan that he had “ultimate authority” over the investigation.

At a congressional hearing last August, FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed that the investigation remained active out of the bureau’s Baltimore field office and said it was a matter that “I expect our folks to pursue aggressively.”

Garland pledged not to interfere in the probe at another hearing in March. An unnamed IRS special agent, though, later alleged mishandling of the investigation in a letter to Congress in which he sought whistleblower protection.

The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then Barack Obama’s vice president, was helping conduct the Obama administration’s foreign policy with Ukraine. Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration’s policies.

Years before the case was brought, Hunter Biden surfaced as a central character in the first impeachment case against Trump, who in an apparent bid to boost his own reelection bid had asked Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a telephone call to announce an investigation into the younger Biden.

Republicans later sought to make Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine a prominent issue during the 2020 presidential election.

In October of that year, the New York Post reported that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.

The story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. No evidence has emerged of any Russian connection to the laptop or to emails found on the device.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the negotiations.

The revelation comes on the heels of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to China where on Monday he met with paramount leader Xi Jinping. While both men said the talks were fruitful, though devoid of clear deliverables, China refused to reestablish military-to-military communications like Washington wanted.

Asked about the report of the Cuba training base talks on Tuesday, Blinken told reporters he had made it “very clear” during his meetings in China this week that Washington has “deep concerns about PRC intelligence or military activities in Cuba.”

“This is something we’re going to be monitoring very very closely,” Blinken added. He spoke in London at a joint press conference with Britain’s foreign secretary James Cleverly.

“I think it’s absolutely vital that we have these kinds of communications, military to military,” Blinken told reporters Monday. “That imperative, I think, was only underscored by recent incidents that we saw in the air and on the seas.”

Ten days ago, the Biden administration admitted China had a spy base in Cuba since at least 2019, after initially saying — without elaboration — that the reporting on negotiations over such a base by the Wall Street Journal, POLITICO and other outlets was “inaccurate.”

Trump administration officials insist they were not aware of intelligence on the spy base while they were in office. But during a Sunday appearance on CNN, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he “would not be surprised” by China’s actions.

Citing current and former U.S. officials, the Journal reported that the proposal for the China-Cuba military training facility was referenced ""in highly classified new U.S. intelligence, which they described as convincing but fragmentary.""

The sources reportedly said the prospect of a facility could mean China permanently hosting troops in Cuba and broadening intelligence gathering against the United States.

One current and one former U.S. official told the Journal the proposed military facility is part of ""Project 141,"" an initiative by China’s People’s Liberation Army to set up a global network of military outposts. The Journal said the White House declined to comment.

Some intelligence officials said Beijing’s sights on Cuba come as a geographical response to the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.

Cuba and Taiwan are each about 100 miles off the U.S. and Chinese mainlands, respectively.

A senior Biden administration official told Fox News Digital that she could not confirm or deny the details of the Journal's reporting or comment on specifics, adding that the White House continues to be concerned about China’s longstanding activities with Cuba.

Immigrant soldiers have served in every significant US conflict since the Revolutionary War, but their presence in the military is often overlooked. When sociologist Sofya Aptekar went searching for immigrant veterans to interview for her new book, Green Card Soldier: Between Model Immigrant and Security Threat, many workers in veteran support offices told her they didn’t exist. “People didn’t understand that you could be in the US military without being a US citizen,” she told me.

In fact, about 7,000 people with green cards join the military each year, according to the Department of Defense. The Immigration and Nationality Act even provides a more streamlined path to citizenship for those who enlist, although even that has become a bureaucratic purgatory for many immigrant soldiers thanks to policy changes that have made the pursuit of citizenship more difficult in the last two decades.

In her book, Aptekar, an associate professor of urban studies at the City University of New York, takes a closer look at the experience of these “green card soldiers”—immigrants in the US military who have lawful permanent residency. Immigrants enlist in the military for many of the same reasons that American-born citizens do, she writes: patriotic duty, a longing for adventure, the desire to embody some sort of masculine ideal, and a lack of employment and educational opportunities. But for many immigrants, military service has additional layers of meaning. Some see enlistment as the height of belonging: a way to integrate, establish their eligibility for citizenship, and demonstrate their allegiance to a country that sees them as owing it a debt. In 2015, for example, Congressman Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who was advocating for a defense bill amendment that would allow for undocumented youth to enlist in the military, spoke about how these immigrants should “have the opportunity to serve and repay their country.”

Although the amendment ultimately did not pass, this sense that immigrants are indebted to their country has persisted, and it’s one of many issues covered in Aptekar’s book. I spoke to her to learn more about the unique problems immigrant military workers face. Our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Can you tell me more about the history of immigrants in the US military?

The United States has been in a conflict or hostility of some sort in every year of its existence. And every year, there have been immigrants—who are noncitizens, not just naturalized immigrants—who’ve fought in all the wars, from helping to take over Indigenous land to putting down slave rebellions. Immigrants were there on both sides of the Civil War. One interesting thing is, there were immigrants who were drafted into the US military. and there used to be mass naturalizations of them all in the 20th century, in World War I and World War II. Some people have said, well, citizenship should be automatic for immigrants who serve in the military today, and I argue against that in my book, because I’ve talked to immigrants who don’t necessarily even want to be US citizens.

What was the purpose of mass naturalizations? And which immigrants actually became citizens?

I mean, it helped that they were mostly European at the time, right? But the US also has a long history of using citizenship for geopolitical purposes. Part of the reason Puerto Ricans got US citizenship in 1917 was so they could all be eligible to be drafted for World War II. And in a lot of conflicts the US military was engaged in during the 19th century, and even earlier, they recruited immigrants into the military. Drafts are often unpopular for everybody, but by attracting more impoverished, racialized groups of people into the military—noncitizens, that is—you may have enough military workers to avoid a draft. That’s happened on multiple occasions in US history. It’s important to note that despite this, Asian immigrants, even the ones who served in the US military, were still excluded from mass naturalizations because there were laws in the books that did not allow foreign agents to become US citizens at the same time. So, it was, of course, a policy that benefited white, European immigrants.

Can you tell me more about the conflicting political narratives surrounding immigrants in the US military?

That’s what a lot of the book is about—it’s a reflection of the bifurcated narratives about immigrants in our society at large. There are positive narratives that focus on immigrant accomplishments and immigrants working hard to “get the job done.” And, of course, there’s also plenty of anti-immigrant discourse—you know, that they abuse social services and are criminals.

We see some of that playing out in the military. Some—the kind of immigrants who have served in the military, especially those who have been killed during combat—are used as proof that immigrants are deserving of rights. You can point to them and say, these immigrants aren’t even citizens yet, and they’re willing to sacrifice their lives for America and American freedoms. A very strong undercurrent of this can be found within some immigrant rights movements as well.

Just like in society at large, there’s a perpetual suspicion of immigrants. In the military, it’s heightened.

But the military talks about the skills that immigrants bring that they need: They speak the language, and they’re familiar with the cultures in the many places that the US military is based around the world. Immigrants also have lower rates of dropping out before their contract is over. That’s kind of the positive discourse, but just like in society at large, there’s a perpetual suspicion of immigrants. In the military, it’s heightened. These are foreigners. They’re not citizens and not born in the United States. Depending on how they’re racialized, people really face suspicion in their military work lives as potentially being spies. For Muslim immigrants that serve in the US military, that’s very powerful, as well as for Asian immigrants, particularly Chinese immigrants.

And it doesn’t fall neatly along party lines. For example, a lot of people are surprised that the Department of Defense is a consistent advocate for the DREAM Act. People assume the Department of Defense is associated more with conservative Republicans, but they currently have a recruitment shortage and would love to have a route for someone to serve in the military and get US citizenship, which is going to open up a vast pool of people for them to recruit from.

You write that immigrant soldiers can help legitimize the military. What does that mean?

Yes. Along those lines, when you have a diverse group of immigrants, you can say, look, these people are not even Americans yet, and they love America so much. They’re willing to die for the country to protect it. That’s super powerful. There are hundreds upon hundreds of US bases around the world, and lots of people in different countries are really angry about them. If you look at public opinions of the US military across the world, it’s not good. In response, the military can point to how immigrants from all over the world are knocking on our doors to let them serve. There’s even a movement by undocumented youth whose slogans repeat: “Let us serve.” That’s very powerful, rhetorically, to be able to point to that—it legitimizes American imperialism.

For some immigrants, joining the military may feel like their only choice. Can you tell me a little bit more about why that is?

It’s important to keep in mind that people do have agency. But we’re also constrained by the society that we live in, which channels an enormous amount of resources into three things: securitization, war, and surveillance, at the cost of other things that people need to survive. Even just growing up in a working-class neighborhood of color, you might have JROTC in your school, or you might be going to a military charter school, and you’re bombarded by military recruitment and marketing. For those who wanted to go to college but didn’t have the resources, this was how they thought they could go. And that’s not unique to immigrants, but it may be exacerbated for some immigrants because they might not have generational wealth.

I remember one story of a young woman from Pakistan whose brother was in deportation proceedings and her family had limited money, and they spent all the money they had to try to save him from being deported. She’s trying to go to community college and works at a gas station at the same time, so she goes to a recruiter’s office and takes the job with the highest recruitment bonus because her family needs to pay off those debts that they had from her brother’s deportation proceedings. Is that a choice? It’s a very constrained one.

In your book, you use the term “the poverty draft” to describe this phenomenon. Can you explain that term?

We don’t have a real draft right now like we did during Vietnam. But what we increasingly have is a “poverty draft.” Impoverishment pushes people into the military as an option that will bring a steady paycheck, with benefits and health care. And it is heavily marketed to us in low-income communities. Immigrants in particular may join the military to speed up the process of assimilating into American society. One person I interviewed was from Kenya, and he told me, when he’s in uniform, it’s the only time he experienced being treated as an American. It also really bothered him that it was only when he was in uniform that happened. Otherwise, he faced so much stigma and discrimination as an African man.

What are some of the psychological scars that immigrants sustain from engaging in what you call the “pervasive violence of military work”?

Yeah, and I want to start by saying that the damage isn’t just psychological. The damage to the body is also very striking. It came out in almost every interview, unprompted, where people would tell me about the extensive injuries to their bodies that they sustained. And a lot of them were younger than me, but were just physically in very bad shape, without actually being in combat. They’re just treated as expendable and their bodies used as tools by the military.

The psychological damage must be put in perspective with the damage that the US military does across the world in terms of just destroying lives and communities, and as you know, polluting the planet. In many cases that I saw, to fit in as an immigrant, as a racialized person, as a woman or queer person into these very rigid hierarchies that are profoundly shaped by patriarchy and white supremacy, requires the type of moral compromising and bending of your humanity, into impossible shapes. One extreme situation that illustrates this, which I describe in the opening of my book, involves an immigrant soldier experiencing the anticipation of having to point a gun at a fellow migrant crossing the border.

Citizenship becomes a way to regulate immigrants’ military labor, like holding a giant carrot in front of them.

Undocumented immigrants can’t currently join the armed forces, but you write that the DOD would like to see that change. Why does the military see undocumented youth as more attractive recruits?

The reason that undocumented immigrant youth are attractive recruits, and I think that the reason the DOD is consistently supporting something like a DREAM Act, is that their citizenship would be tied to their service. They would be beholden to the military in order to get American citizenship. If you’re tying someone’s path to citizenship to completing the terms of their contract, you’re creating a compliant military worker who is going to do what you tell them to do and is potentially not going to complain about sexual harassment, racial discrimination, or what the military is doing around the world or having them do. Citizenship becomes a way to regulate immigrants’ military labor, like holding a giant carrot in front of them. It creates, just like other immigrant workplaces in the United States, a situation where somebody’s status is tied to their employer, and that creates an extra-exploitative atmosphere.

And why is military service seen as a way for immigrants to “repay the United States”?

Yeah, that’s a very strong undercurrent. It’s the story of immigrants being in debt to the United States because they’ve been given access to the American dream. You’re not allowed just to be human and live your own life, but you have to, as an immigrant, prove you are worthy of entry into America. And so military service, for immigrants, is often framed as the repayment of that debt. To the extent that immigrants can ever repay this debt, it really is impossible if you don’t look like you’re from the United States. And I think one of the things I’m trying to do with the book is to really push against those narratives not just with conservatives, but among liberals, immigrant rights movements, and within migrant justice advocacy. It’s a mistake we can’t just attribute to Republicans.

Fighting for the inclusion of immigrants in the military or better treatment of immigrants in the military is not quite addressing the elephant in the room for me, which is what the US military itself does and exists for. I think it’s a bad move by liberals to emphasize this kind of right of access to the military for immigrants and is something that we should question more broadly. That’s the purpose of this book. In the world I want to live in, there is no US military.",left

Now her dream has come true. But instead of serving in Nepal’s military, she recently joined the U.S. Army Reserves.

Bidari, who heads to basic training in August, is just the latest in a growing number of legal migrants entering the U.S. military.

In the U.S., military service is not required. And it has been difficult for the military to get enough people to volunteer. As a result, the Army and Air Force have reached out to immigrants, offering a pathway to citizenship for those who join.

The military is using social media and trying to connect to more people, particularly in inner cities. One important way they do this is by using recruiters with similar backgrounds to the immigrants.

“It is one thing to hear about the military from locals here, but it is something else when it’s from your fellow brother, from the country you’re from,” said Bidari. She was contacted by Army Staff Sergeant Kalden Lama, who is also from Nepal.

Both the Army and the Air Force say they will not meet their recruiting goals this year, and the Navy also expects to fall short.

Defense leaders say young people are more interested in high-paying and less risky jobs. And only about 20 percent of the people who could join the military meet the physical and mental requirements.

Finding immigrants

The military says it faces two big challenges. One is finding ways to reach some immigrant populations. The other is helping them with the complex process to join the service.

The Air Force effort began this year. The first group of 14 finished basic training and became new U.S. citizens in April. They included immigrants from Cameroon, Jamaica, Kenya, the Philippines, Russia and South Africa.

As of mid-May, there were about 100 in basic training who had begun the citizenship process and about 40 who had finished it.

Air Force Major General Ed Thomas is head of the service’s recruiting command. He said the Air Force does extra work to make sure the immigrants are not a security risk. He added that in many cases, immigrants are not put into jobs that require top-secret work.

Under the new Air Force program, immigrants can become citizens as soon as they finish their seven weeks of basic training.

In the Army, close to 2,900 immigrants joined during the first half of this budget year, compared with about 2,200 during the same period last year. The largest numbers are from Jamaica, with 384, followed by Mexico, the Philippines and Haiti. Others are from Nepal, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Colombia and the Dominican Republic.

“Welcome future soldier”

Bidari, from Nepal, arrived in the U.S. in 2016 to attend college. She said becoming a U.S. citizen will make it easier for her to travel and bring her parents to the U.S. to visit. She said she joined the military for six years and hopes that her future citizenship will help her become an officer.

“As a little girl, looking at the soldiers, I always had admiration for them,” said Bidari, talking about British troops in Nepal. She also talked about how she felt the moment she joined the U.S. military:

“I don’t think I have words to really explain how I was feeling. When they said, ‘Welcome future soldier,’ I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, this is happening.’”

SUPREME COURT NEWS: JUSTICES SAVE ‘CLOSELY WATCHED’ CASES FOR THE END OF JUNE

Facing major recruitment shortfalls this year, the Army and Air Force chose, over the past nine months, to broaden their appeal to legal permanent residents, otherwise known as green-card holders, and partnered with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to guarantee that people who successfully complete basic training will be sworn in as U.S. citizen service members.

Early results indicate it is working and could do even more to benefit the United States if it is further expanded as it was 15 years ago.

In the three months since the Air Force rolled out the initiative, 14 trainees from countries including Jamaica, Mexico, Kenya, Russia, and El Salvador have completed basic training and immediately been naturalized at completion. Approximately 100 more are in basic training, an Air Force spokeswoman told the Washington Examiner.

“Their desire to become citizens exemplifies their commitment and dedication to the United States,” Col. John P. O’Dell, 37th Training Wing vice commander, said in a statement . “When we began the partnership with USCIS, we asked all trainees who would be interested in starting their application, and 111 raised their hands. These trainees volunteered to serve a country they aren’t yet citizens of, and now we get to formally recognize them upon their graduation as American Airmen.”

How we got here

Military recruitment has tanked as young adults see less appeal in the mission, cannot meet entry requirements, and are turned off by what they hear in this political climate, Stock said.

""People on the Left, extreme Left, say that people shouldn't join the military. And they tell immigrants that they're going to be victims in the military and the military is a terrible place if you're different at all and it's basically a haven for white supremacists,"" Stock said. ""On the right wing, they're attacking the military for letting people in who aren't American-born.""

The U.S. has a nearly 250-year-long history of allowing newly arrived immigrants to fight alongside Americans.

“Up until 2006, in wartime, U.S. law allowed the military to recruit anybody who was in the country — Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War,” Stock said. “If they were male and they were in the country and of draft age, they got drafted.”

When the problem started

Following Vietnam, the Pentagon required a green card for noncitizens. The number of green-card recruits and, in turn, total new recruits in the military started to drop off because the length of time it took for legal immigrants to obtain a green card grew. As a result, the percentage of immigrants in the military slipped below the percentage of immigrants across the U.S. population.

The lack of immigrants in the military had an impact on national security. The terrorist attacks on 9/11 could have possibly been thwarted through military intercepts; only the military had lacked the staff for those jobs, Stock said.

The Bush administration tapped Stock, an officer at West Point at the time, to fix the problem in the years after the attacks. The Army commissioned Stock to write a predictive paper about the state of recruiting in 2025, and in 2015, she presented the current shortfall in recruitment.

The problem for immigrants who wanted to obtain green cards was that the process took years to navigate. By granting immigrants in good standing who passed a plethora of background checks to become citizens, people who wanted to join but could not have were finally eligible.

Solving the problem

Tasked with coming up with a solution, Stock proposed opening up recruitment to immigrants who did not have a green card. The Department of Defense has the legal authority to recruit people without green cards and bestow expedited citizenship during times of war.

Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates authorized the pilot program, and the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI, program was born. In a few years, it added 15,000 service members.

Stock said people applied in droves. Recruits were ""mostly people with bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, Ph.D.s, professional workers, kind of the cream of the crop [compared to the typical American-born recruit],"" Stock said.

Service members who did not serve honorably for five years risked losing their citizenship. Immigrant recruits had ""fewer behavioral problems"" than native-born Americans and were less likely to drop out, she said.

But the Obama administration did not view the program favorably and walked it back to no longer allow legal immigrants without green cards to join the military.

Where to go now

Illegal immigrants who overstay a visa or are released into the U.S. after crossing the land border illegally are not and have not previously been recruited, Stock said.

The potential to boost recruitment by reopening this mechanism to allow recruits to gain citizenship upon basic training completion was a good start, but more must be done to meet the curve, she said.

""They're still going to have mission failure because it's too hard to get a green card,"" Stock said. ""There is a movement in Congress now, which I'm hoping will be successful, to give people green cards if they join the military. That would solve the military's recruiting problems.""

She said she was contacted recently about how women who had served in the Afghan Special Forces and are now in the U.S. in 2021 could enlist.

""They speak English. They're here legally, but they don't have green cards, and they're not going to get green cards for years because there is no process for getting them a green card quickly,"" Stock said. ""So they can't join the military.""

CNN —

Officials are in a race against time to find a civilian submersible that had five people aboard after it went missing Sunday in the North Atlantic while voyaging to the wreckage of the Titanic.

The 21-foot vessel has four days of emergency capability, the leader of search and rescue efforts said Monday afternoon, as crews with the US and Canadian coast guards continued scouring the ocean’s surface about 900 miles east of Cape Cod and used sonar to listen for sounds far below the water, which is up to 13,000 feet deep in the area.

The five people on board the vessel, which was on an expedition to view the Titanic wreckage, comprised one pilot and four “mission specialists,” Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the US Coast Guard’s First District, said Monday in a news conference. He didn’t identify the five and said authorities still were in the process of contacting family members.

He referred reporters to the group conducting the expedition, OceanGate Expeditions, for information about what the term “mission specialist” entails.

“We’re working very closely at this point to make sure that we’re doing everything that we can do to locate the submersible and rescue those on board,” Mauger said.

The Canadian research ship Polar Prince on Sunday notified the military branch it had lost contact with the underwater vessel, according to Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Samantha Corcoran. In a tweet, the Coast Guard said the communication stopped approximately 1 hour, 45 minutes into the vessel’s dive.

Time is a factor, officials said. “In terms of the hours, we understood that that was 96 hours of rescue or emergency capability from the operator,” Mauger told reporters. “And so we anticipate that there’s somewhere between 70 to the full 96 hours available at this point.”

A British businessman based in the United Arab Emirates, Hamish Harding, is one of the people on the submersible, according to a social media post by the company he owns, Action Aviation.

“The sub had a successful launch and Hamish is currently diving,” the company said in an Instagram post on Sunday.

Harding was one of the first people to travel the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean – the deepest known point on Earth. On Saturday he wrote of the Titanic mission: “I am proud to finally announce that I joined OceanGate Expeditions for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic.”

Search assets include civilian ships

C-130 aircraft were searching the surface and two P-8 planes that use sonar to find submarines were part of the search efforts, Mauger said Monday. Commercial ships are also involved and one has sonar, he added.

“Oftentimes, we rely on commercial operators to be the first vessels on scene,” Mauger said. “And so we’ve been in touch with additional commercial vessels that are operating in the area as well as initiating the movement of additional Canadian Coast Guard assets and US Coast Guard surface assets into the area over the course of the next couple of days.”

The US Coast Guard also has been in touch with the US Navy and the Canadian military to determine what underwater rescue capability is available, if needed, Mauger said.

OceanGate is assisting in the search and said it is “exploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely.”

“Our entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible,” the group said. “We are working toward the safe return of the crewmembers.”

Chief Mi’sel Joe of Miawpukek First Nation, which co-owns the Polar Prince, the support vessel on the expedition, said he received a call Sunday afternoon alerting him the sub was two hours overdue and still hadn’t surfaced, and they had lost communication with the sub. At that point, requests for search and rescue had gone out, he said.

The US Coast Guard tweeted Monday night that its C-130’s had returned to North Carolina and the P-8’s would resume their searches in the morning.

The Polar Prince and the Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing would continue surface searches through the evening, according to the Coast Guard.

Sub has safety features, company says

OceanGate Expeditions operates a trip taking passengers to the Titanic’s wreckage at the bottom of the ocean for prices starting at $250,000, according to an archived version of its website, accessible via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

“Follow in Jacques Cousteau’s footsteps and become an underwater explorer — beginning with a dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. This is your chance to step outside of everyday life and discover something truly extraordinary,” the website said. “Become one of the few to see the Titanic with your own eyes.”

The eight-day expedition is based out of St. John’s, Newfoundland and begins with a 400-nautical-mile journey to the wreck site. There, up to five people, including a pilot, a “content expert” and three paying passengers, board a submersible named “Titan” and descend over two hours to the bottom of the ocean to see the Titanic up close.

According to OceanGate, Titan is a 23,000-pound submersible made of carbon fiber and titanium. As a safety feature, the sub uses a “proprietary real-time hull health monitoring (RTM) system” that analyzes the pressure on the vessel and the integrity of the structure, the company states.

The Titanic infamously hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 people. The wreckage of the Titanic, discovered in 1985, sits in two parts at the bottom of the ocean nearly 13,000 feet below the surface, southeast of Newfoundland.

Unlike a submarine, a submersible has limited power reserves so it needs a mother ship that can launch and recover it, according to NOAA.

‘Think positive’ expedition participant on Polar Prince posts

An expedition participant on board the Polar Prince, the ship that launched the now-missing sub, said they are all “focused on board here for our friends.”

“We have a situation that is now the part of a major Search and Rescue effort, being undertaken by major agencies,” Rory Golden wrote on Facebook after being contacted by CNN. “That is where our focus is right now.”

He asked people not to ask for or speculate on the names of those on the missing sub.

“I have seen some comments already on social media that are highly inappropriate and insensitive,” he said. He added their online and internet options were being restricted “to keep bandwidth available for the coordinated effort that is taking place.”

“The reaction and offers of help globally is truly astonishing, and only goes to show the real goodness in people at a time like this,” he said. He ended the post thanking everyone and saying, “… think positive. We are.”",left

The US Coast Guard said the small submarine began its journey underwater with five passengers Sunday morning, and the Canadian research vessel that it was working with lost contact with the crew about an hour and 45 minutes into the dive.

Officials said a search was underway Monday for the small sub, which takes tourists to view the famous shipwreck that sits about 12,500 feet at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.

OceanGate Expeditions, a private company that provides tours for the site, confirmed that the missing submarine belonged to them, adding that crew members were on board the vessel.

“Our entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families,” the company said in a statement. “We are exploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely.”

The family of world explorer Hamish Harding confirmed on Facebook that he was among the five traveling in the missing submarine.

Harding, a British businessman who previously paid for a space ride aboard The Blue Origin rocket last year, shared a photo of himself on Sunday signing a banner for OceanGate’s latest voyage to the shipwreck.

The traveler boasted about finally being able to get to see the Titanic, noting that because of the poor weather persisting in Newfoundland, Monday morning’s mission would be the only one of 2023.

“We started steaming from St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do,” Harding wrote before the dive.

His stepson, Brian Szasz, shared Harding’s post, writing: “Thoughts and prayers for my stepfather Hamish Harding as his Submarine has gone missing exploring Titanic. Search and rescue mission is underway.”

OceanGate’s sub typically travels with only four days’ worth of oxygen, the BBC reported.

Tickets to view the shipwreck aboard OceanGate’s sub can go as high as $250,000.

The company touts the eight-day trip as a “chance to step outside of everyday life and discover something truly extraordinary.”

The dives themselves can last up to 10 hours each, with the company boasting about recent trips to the Titanic on social media.

OceanGate noted that because of its location in the middle of the Atlantic, they rely on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites for its communications at sea.

The company posted on Twitter that one expedition to the Titanic was ongoing, with two more planned for June 2024.

OceanGate Expeditions CEO Stockton Rush told CBS late last year that his company sees no shortage of “Titaniacs,” people obsessed with the ship who “would mortgage their homes or wouldn’t even blink at the cost of this trip.”

Rush boasted that his five-person sub was one of the few capable of visiting the wreckage.

The Boston Coast Guard did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for additional information on the search.

The wreck of the disaster has remained a popular tourist destination, with passengers taking to the depth to see the haunting site where more than 1,500 passengers died after the “unsinkable” ship struck an iceberg and sank while sailing from Southampton, England, to New York in April 1912.

The wreck was discovered in the Atlantic in 1985 about 370 miles off the Canadian coast, with the ship lying in two parts after it split in half during its sinking.

The catastrophe was immortalized in James Cameron’s 1997 film “Titanic,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The film shattered box office records at the time, earning $2.25 billion.

Last month, Atlantic Productions and deep-sea mapping company Magellan Ltd. released a series of more than 700,000 scans of the wreckage, displaying stunning 3D reconstructions of the doomed cruise liner.

The images were taken by a team using remote-controlled submersibles to survey the ship, a project that took more than 200 hours to complete.",right

After meeting Xi, Blinken said China is not ready to resume military-to-military contacts, something the U.S. considers crucial to avoid miscalculation and conflict, particularly over Taiwan.

Still, China’s main diplomat for the Western Hemisphere, Yang Tao, said he thought Blinken’s visit to China “marks a new beginning.”

“The U.S. side is surely aware of why there is difficulty in military-to-military exchanges,” he said, blaming the issue squarely on U.S. sanctions, which Blinken said revolved entirely around threats to American security.

Yet Blinken and Xi pronounced themselves satisfied with progress made during the two days of talks, without pointing to specific areas of agreement beyond a mutual decision to return to a broad agenda for cooperation and competition endorsed last year year by Xi and President Joe Biden at a summit in Bali.

And, it remained unclear if those understandings can resolve their most important disagreements, many of which have international implications. Still, both men said they were pleased with the outcome of the highest-level U.S. visit to China in five years.

The two sides expressed a willingness to hold more talks, but there was little indication that either is prepared to bend from positions on issues including trade, Taiwan, human rights conditions in China and Hong Kong, Chinese military assertiveness in the South China Sea, and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Blinken said later that the U.S. set limited objectives for the trip and achieved them. He told reporters before leaving for a Ukraine reconstruction conference in London that he had raised the issue of military to military communications “repeatedly.”

“It is absolutely vital that we have these kinds of communications,” he said. “This is something we’re going to keep working on.”

Speaking to reporters Monday during a campaign fundraising trip to California, Biden said Blinken did a “hell of a job.” The president said “you know” progress was made with relations between the U.S. and China because of the meeting.

The U.S. has said that, since 2021, China has declined or failed to respond to over a dozen requests from the Department of Defense for top-level dialogues.

According to a transcript of the meeting with Blinken, Xi said he was pleased with the outcome of Blinken’s earlier meetings with top Chinese diplomats and said restarting the Bali agenda were of great importance.

“The Chinese side has made our position clear, and the two sides have agreed to follow through the common understandings President Biden and I had reached in Bali,” Xi said.

That agenda had been thrown into jeopardy in recent months, notably after the U.S. shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over its airspace in February, and amid escalated military activity in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Combined with other disputes over human rights, trade and opiate production, the list of problem areas is daunting.

But also Xi suggested the worst could be over.

“The two sides have also made progress and reached agreement on some specific issues,” Xi said without elaborating, according to a transcript of the remarks released by the State Department. “This is very good.”

In his remarks to Xi during the 35-minute session at the Great Hall of the People, a meeting that was expected but not announced until an hour before it started, Blinken said “the United States and China have an obligation and responsibility to manage our relationship.”

“The United States is committed to doing that,” Blinken said. “It’s in the interest of the United States, in the interests of China, and in the interest of the world.”

Blinken described his earlier discussions with senior Chinese officials as “candid and constructive.”

Despite the symbolism of his presence in China, Blinken and other U.S. officials had played down the prospects for any significant breakthroughs on the most vexing issues facing the planet’s two largest economies.

Instead, these officials have emphasized the importance of the two countries establishing and maintaining better lines of communication.

Thus, China’s refusal to resume the military-to-military contacts was a hitch.

“Progress is hard,” Blinken told reporters. “It takes time, it takes more than one visit.”

Blinken’s trip is expected to herald a new round of visits by senior U.S. and Chinese officials to each other’s countries, possibly including a meeting between Xi and Biden in India or the U.S in the coming months.

Before meeting with Xi, Blinken met earlier Monday with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi for about three hours, an encounter that produced a harsh assessment of the talks.

China’s foreign ministry said “it is necessary to make a choice between dialogue or confrontation, cooperation or conflict.” It blamed the “U.S. side’s erroneous perception of China, leading to incorrect policies towards China” for the current “low point” in relations.

And, it said the U.S. bore responsibility for halting “the spiraling decline of China-U.S. relations to push it back to a healthy and stable track.” It added that Wang had “demanded that the U.S. stop hyping up the ‘China threat theory,’ lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China, abandon suppression of China’s technological development, and refrain from arbitrary interference in China’s internal affairs.”

In it’s readout of the meeting, the State Department said Blinken “underscored the importance of responsibly managing the competition between the United States and the PRC through open channels of communication to ensure competition does not veer into conflict,” using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China.

In the first round of talks on Sunday, Blinken met for nearly six hours with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, after which both countries said they had agreed to continue high-level discussions.

Both the U.S. and China said Qin had accepted an invitation from Blinken to visit Washington but Beijing made clear that “the China-U.S. relationship is at the lowest point since its establishment.” That sentiment is widely shared by U.S. officials.

Blinken’s visit came after his initial plans to travel to China were postponed in February after the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon over the U.S.

In his meetings, Blinken also pressed the Chinese to release detained American citizens and to take steps to curb the production and export of fentanyl precursors that are fueling the opioid crisis in the United States.

Since the cancellation of Blinken’s trip in February, there have been some high-level engagements. CIA chief William Burns traveled to China in May, while China’s commerce minister traveled to the U.S. And Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Wang Yi in Vienna in May.

But those have been punctuated by bursts of angry rhetoric from both countries over the Taiwan Strait, their broader intentions in the Indo-Pacific, China’s refusal to condemn Russia for its war against Ukraine, and U.S. allegations from Washington that Beijing is attempting to boost its worldwide surveillance capabilities, including in Cuba.

And, earlier this month, China’s defense minister rebuffed a request from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for a meeting on the sidelines of a security symposium in Singapore, a sign of continuing discontent.

Blinken’s comment comes amid increased tensions between China and the United States related to Taiwan. Last week, Taiwan's air force scrambled fighter jets after a group of 10 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait for the second time in a matter of days.

This month, the U.S. military released video of a close encounter between a Chinese navy ship and an American destroyer in the Taiwan Strait, and there have been several close calls between Chinese and U.S. military aircraft recently, including an air intercept by a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea in late May.

Blinken acknowledged that China did not agree to set up a crisis military-to-military communications channel which had been one of the goals of the U.S. heading into the meeting.

Over the last year, the U.S. and China saw more than $700 billion in trade which according to Blinken constituted the highest level between the two countries on record. He reiterated U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's testimony before Congress last week that it would be ""disastrous"" for the U.S. to decouple and stop all trade and investment with China.

Callaghan O'Hare | Reuters

For more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities. It marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed — after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Since it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events. People who never gave the holiday on June 19 more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a ""right"" way to celebrate Juneteenth? For beginners and those brushing up history, here are some answers:

Is Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?

It just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as ""Black Codes,"" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life. Alan Freeman, 60, grew up celebrating Juneteenth every year in Houston, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Galveston. A comedian who is producing Galveston's first-ever Juneteenth Comedy Festival on Saturday, he has vivid memories of smoke permeating his entire neighborhood because so many people were using their barbecue pits for celebratory cookouts. You could go to anyone's house and be welcomed to join in the feast, which could include grilled chicken and beef and other regional cuisines — jerk meats, fried fish, Jamaican plantains. ""It's where I began to really see Black unity because I realized that that was the one day that African Americans considered ours,"" Freeman said. ""The one holiday that was ours. We didn't have to share with anybody. And it was about freedom because what we understood is that we were emancipated from slavery. But, there was so many beautiful activities."" Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off. The important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture. ""Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'"" Anderson said. ""I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.""

What if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?

Anderson, 57, of Columbia, Maryland, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s. ""I think many folks haven't known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,"" Anderson said. ""It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history."" For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state. Anderson has no special event planned other than giving his employees Friday and Monday off. If anything, Anderson is thinking about the fact it's Father's Day this weekend. ""If I can unite Father's Day and Juneteenth to be with my family and honor them, that would be wonderful,"" he said. What kind of public events are going on around the country? Search online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.

Are there special foods served on Juneteenth?

Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.

Does how you celebrate matter if you aren't Black?

Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it. ""I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,"" Brown said. ""It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law."" If you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to ""make your mind better,"" Anderson said. ""That goes longer than a celebration,"" Anderson said. ""I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area."" If you're struggling with how to ""ethically"" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby. ""Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,"" she said. ""That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.""

What are other names used to describe Juneteenth?

Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others. ""Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,"" Brown said. ""Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.""

GOP lawmakers are pushing deep tax cuts for companies and the affluent as the primary driver for sustaining economic growth, while President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats seek more targeted tax cuts to achieve social goals such as reducing child poverty and shifting to renewable energy that can help the economy in the long run.

The Republican tax cuts for businesses, coupled with an increase in the standard deduction for households, would be funded by wiping out $216 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that Biden signed into law last year to support the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy.

“They should look at this plan as more jobs, higher wages,” said Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “We are undoing bad policy and replacing it with good.”

White House officials say Republicans’ quick pivot to tax cuts reveals they were never sincere about shrinking deficits during the debt limit debate. Many — but not all — of the tax changes that Republicans last week passed out of the Ways and Means Committee would be temporary.

If the proposed changes related to corporate taxes were made permanent, the Biden administration says, it would undermine the spending cuts that were part of the agreement this month to raise the government’s borrowing authority.

“No sooner did we get a balanced bipartisan agreement to reduce deficits than they came back and put $500 billion of tax cuts for businesses on the table,” said Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “It’s just inconsistent.”

The dispute sets the stage for the 2024 elections and the immediate economic challenges that the winners will face: Lawmakers will need to raise the debt limit again and key portions of the 2017 tax cuts passed under then-President Donald Trump will expire and cause taxes to rise for most households unless they are extended.

Democrats say the latest Republican plan would largely favor companies and better-off households. It would make certain tax breaks for businesses retroactive to 2022. The White House says that tax breaks for what companies did in the past would do little to create the jobs that Republicans are promising.

“Let’s really dig in and ask, ‘How will these business tax breaks affect things people care about?’ They care about good jobs in their communities,” Brainard said. “Is a retroactive tax windfall going to result in a single additional job?”

While Republicans are premising their tax cuts on the need to get tax relief flowing through the economy, Democrats are positioning their preferred tax breaks as investments that would occur over decades.

That difference matters as Republicans believe jobs are likely to come from lower effective rates and policies such as permanently making it easier for small businesses to fully expense the cost of new business equipment and changing the IRS requirements for companies using contractors. Democrats counter that tax breaks to help children and provide market signals for cleaner energy will deliver growth in the long run.

“The really fundamental part of key policies has to be around how do we make long-term investments that help our communities, help our families,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Republicans have been short-term thinkers and are really focused on the wealthy and well connected.”

One key difference between parties is how they would get money to families. The GOP bill would increase the standard deduction by $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families in 2024 and 2025. That might sound like a lot of money, but it’s less than one might think because those totals apply to the amount of income that’s taxable rather than savings.

By definition, lower earners would receive less money back from a more generous standard deduction. The bottom 40% of households would on average have tax cuts of less than $12 a month, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Households in the top 20% would have an average monthly tax cut of $46.

Smith defended his plan by saying it grew out of what voters told his committee at field hearings in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Georgia. He said that the three bills that are part of the tax plan grew out of the hearings that began in February and reflected what lawmakers heard from voters.

“Everything in the legislation that we passed out came from discussions or ideas at all of these hearings outside of Washington,” Smith said. “So this bill is for working class families.”

By contrast, Democrats would rather help families by renewing the expanded child tax credit, which became more accessible and increased in size because of Biden’s 2021 coronavirus pandemic relief package. Families could get monthly payments of as much as $300 per child as part of the expansion, which lapsed after one year. The child poverty rate fell to a record low of 5.2% in 2021 because of the payments.

Another source of tension is how Republicans structure their costs. Many of their tax cuts would expire after 2025, even though they’d like to make their policies permanent. But the Biden tax breaks they want to eliminate extend over 10 years, leading to the charge that Republicans are hiding the full expense of their tax cuts. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget indicates that the costs of making the entire GOP plan permanent would exceed $1 trillion, eliminating almost all of the savings from spending cuts that were part of the debt limit agreement.

“The most cynical part of this is the cost,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “They’re taking 10 years of revenue and using it to pay for two years of tax cuts. They make the tax cuts temporary so it looks like it costs less than it actually costs.”

The Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning policy organization, estimated that the GOP bills would slightly boost the size of the U.S. economy in 2024 and 2025. But the benefits are limited because the business tax cuts are mostly temporary and unlikely to change the investment and hiring choices of companies.

“When you’re thinking about how tax policy can improve the economy, all of that is long-term decision-making,” said Erica York, senior economist at the Tax Foundation. “If you want this to be as meaningful as it can be, then it needs to be made permanently.”

While the House bill is unlikely to pass the Senate or get signed by Biden, it’s part of a broader message on how each party thinks about the tax code. Just as Democrats are deeply skeptical that the GOP’s cuts would produce growth, Republicans are wary about administering social policy through the IRS. Those differences point toward the risks in 2025, when the debt limit drama restarts and tax breaks for the middle class and wealthy alike are on the verge of lapsing.

“There’s a fundamental disconnect about the purpose of the tax code,” York said. “That sets us up in 2025 for a whole bunch of uncertainty.”",left

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday unveiled a series of new tax breaks aimed at businesses and families while proposing to reverse some of President Joe Biden's legislative victories, including credits to spur the sale of clean-burning electric vehicles.

Three related bills were introduced on Friday with the goal of moving the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee next week. That is when the Joint Committee on Taxation also is expected to release its analysis of the package.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre termed the proposals a ""tax scam"" and alleged that ""(Republican) priority isn't reducing the deficit or out-competing the world, their priority is giving handouts to rich special interests and corporations at the expense of everyone else.""

Democrats already were focusing on whether the tax legislation could add to the ballooning federal debt.

""These policies will provide relief for working families, strengthen small businesses, grow jobs, and protect American innovation and competitiveness,"" Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement.

The committee said there are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of provisions included. Some are expansions of tax breaks while others eliminate or roll back existing ones, such as Biden's electric vehicle credit.

Representative Richard Neal, the panel's senior Democrat, said Republicans were ""laying the groundwork for even bigger cuts in 2025"" when provisions of the 2017 tax law expire. The measure introduced on Friday, Neal said, would usher in ""retroactive corporate tax cuts, next-to-nothing for the most vulnerable children and families, and sneaking in favors for Big Oil.""

Republicans, who control the House, introduced the proposals days after Biden, a Democrat, signed into law legislation Republicans sought to begin addressing the rapidly-growing debt with about $1.3 trillion in spending cuts.

The law was coupled with an urgently needed increase in U.S. borrowing authority by suspending the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025.

Under the proposed legislation, married couples filing jointly would receive a $4,000 ""deduction bonus"" for two years that the committee said would potentially help up to 107 million families who take the standard deduction.

The legislation also would significantly increase the way businesses could claim depreciation deductions, raising the threshold to a permanent $2.5 million from the current $1 million that was contained in the Republicans' broad 2017 tax cut package.

Other provisions include an expansion of tax benefits for small start-up enterprises to ""S Corporations,"" while eliminating some ""red tape"" that small businesses experience related to contract workers.

Democrats on the Ways and Means panel are expected to offer amendments to the bill, including a permanent expansion of an expired portion of the Child Tax Credit that lifted nearly 4 million children out of poverty in just one year during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans have opposed the measure.

Any bill that emerges from the House would likely face stiff opposition in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

It includes increasing the standard deduction on income taxes, expanding opportunity zones, slapping an excise tax on property purchases linked to China and Russia, rolling back some requirements for reporting transactions to the Internal Revenue Service and restoring expired Trump-era business expense write-offs.

The House’s Republican tax writers face complications, including opposition from President Biden and the Democratic-run Senate. The plan lays down a marker on tax policy and invites debate and negotiation about Americans’ tax burdens.

Under the Republican plan, the standard deduction for singles or married couples filing separately would increase by $2,000 to $15,850. For married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction would increase by $4,000 to $30,700.

“With this provision in place, an American family of four will not pay a cent in federal taxes on their first $68,000 of income,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, Missouri Republican. “This allows Americans to keep more of their hard-earned dollars to spend as they see fit to address their individual and family needs.”

Other than lowering the tax burden, the bill expands opportunity zones to rural areas and imposes a 60% excise tax on the purchase of U.S. land by individuals and entities linked to Russia and China.

Most of the provisions are intended to stimulate American manufacturing and small businesses.

The proposal would overturn Mr. Biden’s climate change law provision requiring third-party payment processors, including Venmo and PayPal, to report transactions above $600. Earlier this year, the IRS postponed the reporting requirement until 2024.

“The IRS has no business going after Americans who sell things like an old couch or concert tickets on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist,” Mr. Smith said.

Mr. Biden’s climate bill instituted a similar reporting requirement for businesses that pay contractors more than $600 a year. Republican lawmakers are pushing to nullify the requirement. They note that the former threshold of $5,000 had not been changed since 1954.

House Republicans also want to make it easier for small businesses to immediately deduct investments in new equipment from their taxes. Currently, firms may deduct $1 million worth of investments in new equipment or other productivity measures. The Republican bill would increase that cap to $2.5 million.

The Republican bill would restore a recently expired provision from the Trump-era tax cuts allowing companies to immediately deduct research and development costs. As of 2022, firms are required to spread out the costs of investments in research and development over a five- to 15-year period.

The legislation expands companies’ ability to deduct larger shares of their borrowing costs to make up for increased interest rates.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat, said members of his party could accept some expensing provisions, especially for research and development.

“Democrats are on board with fixing business tax incentives like R&D expensing as long as Congress also passes support for the most vulnerable children and families on the same scale,” Mr. Wyden said.

Mr. Wyden said business tax benefits could move alongside a revived child tax credit expansion. The expanded tax credit, a COVID-era provision that gave parents with children younger than 6 more than $300 a month, is a nonstarter for Republicans.

Even if Republicans accept more child tax credits, plenty of other provisions likely make their package unacceptable to Democrats. The biggest point of contention will be the Republicans’ push to pay for the tax cuts by rescinding more than $200 billion in green energy tax credits from Mr. Biden’s climate law.

“It goes without saying that repealing landmark clean energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act is a nonstarter in the Senate,” Mr. Wyden said.

Democrats are also likely to oppose the bill’s repeal of a superfund tax on petroleum and the cancellation of electric vehicle tax credits that Republicans say have “ballooned in cost by over 700% since last year.”

“While Americans are sheltering inside to avoid the fallout of climate-spurred wildfires, Republicans think now is a good time to repeal the largest climate investment in our history to pay for their corporate handouts,” said Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.

Democrats are not the only obstacles to the tax cut package. To pass the House, the legislation first must garner enough support in the fractured Republican Conference.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy can lose only four Republican votes on any legislation before relying on Democrats, and more than a dozen moderate House Republicans from high-tax Democratic-leaning states are on the fence.

They are concerned that the bill does not address the level of state and local tax, or SALT, deductions on IRS forms.

The deduction once provided significant relief in states such as New York and California, where property taxes and other fees are high. The Trump-era tax cuts capped the deduction at $10,000 per year.

“I won’t support any tax bill that doesn’t adequately address SALT,” said Rep. Mike Garcia, California Republican. “It doesn’t have to be a full removal, but it needs to be something.”

Mr. Smith and other Republican leaders said they are working to amend the Republican bill to address the SALT issue.

Restoring the deduction could make the tax package all the more difficult to pass, given the spending limits imposed by the debt limit deal that Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Biden struck last month.

The deal keeps domestic spending flat for the upcoming fiscal year while boosting defense spending by 3 percentage points. It also caps spending growth next year at 1%.

The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the tax package would cost $21 billion over the next decade, but only if Republicans succeed in rescinding $216 billion worth of green energy tax credits.

Without the green energy clawback, the total cost of the $237 billion tax cut package could run afoul of the debt limit agreement.
